# See Through Facebook groups

The objective is to synthesise data about the Facebook groups owned by See Through, so that its collective breadth and depth can be made visible to the world in true [Transparent Trojan Horseplay](https://seethroughnetwork.org/#trojan-horse) style.

This will involve: 

1. Acquiring Facebook’s unique identifiers for each group
2. Rigorously aligning each group with relevant geographic taxonomies for each country
3. Assigning each group a set of Lat/Lng coordinates
4. Regularly querying the Facebook Groups API for member numbers
5. Pushing all this data to a database
6. Developing templates to dynamically present the results.
